This as a fork of https://github.com/thujohn/rss-l4 which is no longer maintained 
and does not support Laravel >5. 

## Changes
- As this has no `composer.json` it does not have any requirements, 
  so works with any (compatible ) Laravel version
- The namespace has been changed to `Contentify\Vendor`
- Added some parameter/return types and type annotations and extra comments
- Only the core files have been kept and the `README.md`has been replaced by this one
